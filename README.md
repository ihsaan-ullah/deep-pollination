## Introduction
Insects are very important for biodiversity, food chains, and pollination. It is of great importance to recognize insects, their habitats and to secure their natural environment. Machine learning, especially deep learning techniques can be used to recognize and classify various insects. We introduce **Deep-Pollination**, a series of three machine learning challenges organized on Codalab for insects classification. A preprocessed version of the insects dataset is used for these challenges which consists of five classes and more than 200,000 images.

## Data
The data is provided by MUSÉUM NATIONAL D’HISTOIRE NATURELLE. The data set contains 5 classes where each class refers to a type of insect:
-   bee 
-   wasp
-   butterfly 
-   other insect
-   other(non-insect)  

There are more than 210,000 images provided for this competition.
